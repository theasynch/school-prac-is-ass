"""
Logically, the functions sub1() and cube2() are doing the same thing.
That is, finding the difference between two values.

However, they are practically different. Since :

- There are two arguments in sub1() but just one in cube2()
- The sub1() fucntion actually prints out the difference but cube2() only returns it to the program.
    making the user unaware of the output.
